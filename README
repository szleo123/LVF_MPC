How to run the code? 
1. Go to ./variational_state_space_models 
2. Use ./docker/build.sh to build docker container
3. Use ./docker/run.sh to enter the container 
4. Install cvxpy, pytope, polytope packages insider the container using pip3 
5. Run lsvae/train_lsvae.py to start training 
6. Go to ./variational_state_space_models/lsvae
7. Use python3 MPC_robust.py (path to model checkpoint) to run the MPChttps://github.com/szleo123/LVF_MPC/blob/main/README

Resulting images of MPC will be saved in ./MPC folder
